# Build a SQLITE clone

Follows the tutorial - <https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/> - up to part 13, at which point the tutorial is discontinued, leaving me to improvise ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Testing

`sudo gem install rspec`
`rspec ./spec/database.rb`

## Developing

Compile the codebase into an executable file, by using the Makefile instructions:

`make`
